# Digital Logic Design (DLD) Lab Works

This repository contains all the lab assignments and circuit design files (`.circ`) for my Digital Logic Design (DLD) course. These circuits were designed and simulated using [Logisim](http.www.cburch.com/logisim/), an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

## 📝 Description
The main objective of this project is to create and store simulations of fundamental digital logic design concepts. The labs cover a range of topics, including basic logic gates, combinational circuits like adders and multiplexers, and sequential circuits like flip-flops and counters.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To run or edit these `.circ` files on your computer, you will need the following software installed:

1.  **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Logisim is a Java-based application and requires JRE to run.
    * 📥 **Download Link:** [Official Java Website](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

2.  **Logisim:** The tool used to create and simulate the circuits.
    * 📥 **Download Link:** [Official Logisim Website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html)

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  First, ensure that you have the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the link above.
2.  Download the **Logisim** software. It is a standalone application and does not require a formal installation process.
3.  Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Zero-Asif/Digital_Logic_Design.git](https://github.com/Zero-Asif/Digital_Logic_Design.git)
    ```
    Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file by clicking on **Code > Download ZIP**.

4.  Launch the Logisim application (`.jar` or `.exe` file).
5.  Go to `File -> Open` from the menu bar and navigate to the cloned repository folder to open any `.circ` file. You can now view, simulate, or edit the circuit.
